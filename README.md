## Prerequisites

- python 3.7




## Run Server

    - Download the server and extract it.
    - Execute "main.py" file
- On Linux:

    - Open Terminal and install Python by executing following command:
    ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip```
    - Download the server and extract it.
    - Execute "main.py" file

## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](https://mega.nz/file/3ORQARKK#FZGPWFNS6kAN_0rJglhqozter5IY-ANRS5gN6zHPlPk). Just replace the IP in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libgg.config.so```) ```{"interaction":{"interaction":{"type":"script","path":"libscript.so","on_change":"reload","parameters":{"redirectHost":"YOUR_IP","relocate":true}}}```
